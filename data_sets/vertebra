Due to space reasons we do not make our processed version of this data set available on github.
This is the Head Aneurysm data set from the Volvis repository (http://volvis.org).
The .raw file can be read into MATLAB with the following commands:

>> fileID=fopen('vertebra16.raw','r');
>> A=fread(fileID,512*512*512,'int16');
>> B=reshape(A,[512 512 512]);

After this, one can prepare the input for DIPHA with the command:

>> save_image_data(B,'vertebra.bin');

and for PERSEUS with the following command:

>>  save_image_data_perseus(B,'vertebra.txt');

where the script save_image_data.m was provided by the developers of DIPHA, 
while we provide the script save_image_data_perseus.m (see also the accompanying tutorial).
